# What is Anujs?

Anujs is an immersive data visualization toolkit built on the web-based 3D game engine [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/). Anu is heavily inspired by [D3's](https://d3js.org/) data-binding DOM manipulation patterns and visualization utility. Anu works in synergy with D3 to bring these patterns to Babylon, enabling developers to dynamically manipulate the Babylon scene graph with data and augment 3D immersive visualizations with utilities, pre-fabs, and interactions. 

Anu is currently in Alpha version 0.0.1. This means that the library syntax, methods, and functions are still very fluid. As a result changes may not be backwards compatible with previous versions as we continue to develop and improve the library. This also means that now is the best time to contribute! See our github repo for more information about the current road map and how to contribute.
